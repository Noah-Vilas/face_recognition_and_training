# face_recognition_and_training
Allows you to train a facial recognition algorithm to recognize specific people


choose the amount of people to train, then input the new users name, the program will then take pictures
of the person and train the algorithm to detect them, you can set a main user if prompted, which will take more pictures
after training it will create a stream so you can see the camera view and make a guess on who each person in the photo is
along with the percentage that its correct.
